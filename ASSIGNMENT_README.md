## Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive CPU simulator with a custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), demonstrating key computer architecture concepts.

## CPU Architecture
- 32-bit word size
- 8 general-purpose registers (R0-R7)
- Special purpose registers: Program Counter, Stack Pointer
- 4096-byte memory
- Comprehensive flag system (Zero, Negative, Overflow, Carry, Interrupt)

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
### Instruction Categories
1. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - ADD
   - SUB
   - MUL
   - DIV

2. **Logical Operations**
   - AND
   - OR
   - XOR
   - NOT

3. **Data Movement**
   - LOAD
   - STORE
   - MOVE

4. **Control Flow**
   - JUMP
   - BRANCH
   - CALL
   - RETURN

5. **System Operations**
   - HALT

## Memory Layout
- Total Memory: 4096 bytes
- Segments:
  - Code Segment
  - Data Segment
  - Stack Segment
  - Heap Segment

## Recursive Function Demonstration
A sample recursive function (factorial calculation) is implemented to showcase:
- Stack usage during recursive calls
- Context switching
- Register and memory state tracking
